    <h1>Welcome to Kurgan MUD</h1>
    <p class="lead">This is the official website for the <a href="https://github.com/ozgyilmaz/kurgan/">open-source</a> Kurgan MUD project.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>What is a MUD?</h2>
    <p>This game is set in an imaginary era where individuals from various races rely on their intelligence, wisdom, speed, or strength in a relentless struggle to survive and become powerful. It is a world where the weak are destined to perish. It is a ruthless world.</p>
    <p>Here, players embody the characters they create and control. MUD is a text-based gameâ€”everything that happens is reflected to you in written form, and you respond by typing commands. Immersing yourself in the vivid world described through flowing text can bring you unforgettable moments of fear and excitement.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Beyond a Game</h2>
    <p>Numerous theses, academic studies, and even psychological consultations in the past have pointed out that MUDs are more than just games. They often symbolize people's longing to escape cramped, unnatural city life and return to the wild, natural, and primal way of living.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>Technically speaking, MUD stands for Multi-User Dungeon, a type of Fantasy Role-Playing Game (FRP) played online. It is entirely text-based and contains no graphics apart from limited text coloring.</p>
    <p>Unlike traditional RPGs, MUDs are not installed or sold on CDs. Like Knight Online or World of Warcraft, they are played by connecting to a remote server.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>The World of a MUD</h2>
    <p>When you play a MUD, you connect to a remote server and create a character, which is stored on that server. By nature, MUDs are multiplayer.</p>
    <p>Each MUD consists of a vast map made up of interconnected rooms. These rooms form regions, and regions make up the MUD world.</p>
    <p>Rooms are connected in six directions: north, south, east, west, up, and down. To move between rooms, all you have to do is type the direction. We call this "walking".</p>
